# Tasks Project, Full-Stack

Create a React front-end application communicating with a Python backend with a basic CRUD RESTful API.

The application should showcase the ability to add tasks from a user interface and display the changes within a browser.  The interface is required to be intuitive enough to manipulate a basic tasks data schema.

##### Tasks application interface must:

- Use the **React** Javascript Framework
- Use at least one custom React component
- Use at least one custom method to handle data manipulation
- Be documented in code
- Have tests for provided custom method(s)
  - Use any Javascript testing framework
  - Must be testable from `npm test` or `yarn test` respectively
  Have functional tests provided for back-end API endpoints using pytest
- Successfully build from command line

##### Tasks application backend must:

- Be written in **Python**
- Utilize the **Django** Python framework
- Connect to a **Postgres** database
  - Include migrations and initial schema for a fresh install
- Include all CRUD endpoints
  - Create task
  - Read ...
  - Update ...
  - Delete ...
- Have functional tests provided with **Pytest**
- Include a `requirements.txt` file with proper dependencies
- Include API documentation

##### Bonus points for:

- Showcased usage of **Redux**, **Mobx**, etc
- Integration of **Styled Components**
- Integration of **eslint**, **prettier**, **standard**, etc
- Integration of **yapf**, **autopep**, **black**, etc
- Application is packaged with **Docker**, **Vagrant**, or other virtual machine solution, etc
- Anything you feel fun to add to showcase your Javascript and Python powers

### Project Delivery

Please deliver the code for your project in a Github repository complete with a `README.md` supplying instructions on installation, testing and building. The repo must clearly show your initial commit as well as a well-described chain of commits showing the evolution of your progress.

Send your repo link to sean@trym.io once you're all wrapped up.

Have fun, and good luck!
