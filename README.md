# Tasks Project, Front-End

Create a React web application that consumes the provided JSON data payload of farm tasks, displaying them in a user-friendly way as to be consumed by anyone looking at the application.

The application should show a functional display of the JSON data.  For example; a calendar view, an "upcoming tasks" view, etc.  Be as creative as you'd like here.

JSON API: https://code.trym.io/api/tasks

##### Tasks application must:
- Use the React Javascript Framework
- Use at least one custom React component
- Use at least one custom method to handle data manipulation
- Must consume JSON data via API (provided above)
- Display multiple data inputs from provided JSON 
- Be documented in code
- Have tests for provided methods
  - Use any Javascript testing framework
  - Must be testable from `npm test` or `yarn test` respectively
- Successfully build from command line

##### Bonus points for:
- Showcased usage of Redux, Mobx, etc
- Integration of `styled-components`: https://www.styled-components.com/docs
- Ability to add new tasks to the visual output
- Ability to manipulate existing tasks
- Integration of `eslint`, `prettier`, `standard`, etc
- Integration with a provided backend API using Restify, Express, etc
- Live application deployment to Heroku, Firebase, etc
- Anything you feel fun to add to showcase your Javascript powers
